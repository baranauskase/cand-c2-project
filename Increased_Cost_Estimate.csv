The higher budget means that we can afford more redundancy in the system. The first change that I would make is change the RDS instance to a multi availability zone configuration. I would also introduce another read replica to reduce the load on a master instance. The next change is to get more EC2 instance for the auto scaling groups of web and app servers. The two auto scaling groups would be reconfigured to span the same availability zones as per new RDS configuration. This set of changes would make disaster recovery very quick in case of loss of availability zone.,,,,,,,,
