"The first change to reduce costs was to make a commitment of reserving all EC2 and RDS instances for one year without upfront payment. Reserving an instance for one year strikes a good balance between flexibility of changing the infrastructure in the near future whilst also offering a good saving. There are of course further savings to be made by reserving instances for three years and making upfront payments, but these are only appropriate when application usage pattern is very well understood, and funds are available. The next change that IÕve made is removed the read replicas from the RDS instance. This potentially sacrifices the availability of the application in exchange for saving money on the bill.",,,,,,,,
